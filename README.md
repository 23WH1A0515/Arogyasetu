# ArogyaSetu

ArogyaSetu is a city-level healthcare surge monitoring system designed to help hospitals prepare for sudden increases in patient load.  
It focuses on prediction, visibility, and smarter resource coordination across multiple hospitals.

---

## 🩺 The Problem

Hospitals often experience unexpected patient surges due to:

- Festivals and public gatherings  
- Pollution spikes  
- Seasonal outbreaks  
- Epidemic situations  

This leads to overcrowding, long wait times, uneven resource distribution, and staff fatigue.

Most responses are reactive — action is taken only after hospitals are already overwhelmed.

---

## 💡 The Approach

ArogyaSetu provides a centralized dashboard that:

- Monitors hospital capacity in real time  
- Predicts potential patient surges  
- Highlights high-risk zones  
- Suggests basic load balancing strategies  
- Tracks staff workload trends  

Instead of managing hospitals individually, it views the city’s healthcare system as one connected network.
